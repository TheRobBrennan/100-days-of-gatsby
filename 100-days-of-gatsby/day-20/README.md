# Day 20 - Monday, January 20th, 2020

Today's focus is on the blog post [Image Optimization Made Easy with Gatsby](https://medium.com/@kyle.robert.gill/ridiculously-easy-image-optimization-with-gatsby-js-59d48e15db6e)

This article was an easy skim. The technique mentioned by the author is similar to what I've done in previous work with Gatsby images. No need to reinvent the wheel here.

This example app will not include an image - so I will leave the app to display "Day 20" in the header and call it good.
