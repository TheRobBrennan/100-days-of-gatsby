# Day 49 - Tuesday, February 18th, 2020

I am pleased to say that today is my last day of the #100DaysOfGatsby. I have enjoyed this challenge, and the work has led me down a path of several things that need my immediate attention and shipping - all using Gatsby in some form or another. ðŸ¤“

Stay tuned. There is a lot of exciting stuff on the horizon, but I need to direct my energy toward these fun projects.
