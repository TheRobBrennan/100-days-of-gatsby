# Day 21 - Tuesday, January 21st, 2020

Today's focus is on incorporating [Jest](https://jestjs.io) into a Gatsby project for automated unit and integration testing.

Let's take a look at the official example from Gatsby at [https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-jest](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-jest).

As an added bonus, I've added a `test:coverage` script to generate a code coverage report (100% coverage as of this writing) as well as automatically open a web browser to the generated report to review our test coverage ü§ì

## Scratchpad

To create a new Gatsby app, I will use `npx` to create a new [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) app using the latest version of the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com):

```sh
# Generate a new app using the latest version of the Gatsby CLI
$ npx gatsby new app
  # OPTIONAL: Copy the Dockerized Gatsby CLI example to an appropriate folder for a faster starting point
  $ cp -r 100-days-of-gatsby/default-gatsby-cli-app-dockerized 100-days-of-gatsby/day-##

# Navigate to the appropriate example directory
$ cd 100-days-of-gatsby/day-##

# Navigate to the app directory
$ cd app
```

## Ready?

Using the official example from Gatsby as a guide, we can see we need to install the following dev dependencies:

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^4.0.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^9.1.1",
    "babel-jest": "^24.0.0",
    "babel-preset-gatsby": "^0.1.6",
    "identity-obj-proxy": "^3.0.0",
    "jest": "^24.0.0"
  },
```

I'm going to see what happens installing the latest versions of these `devDependencies`.

```sh
# Install Jest
$ npm i -D jest

# Install Babel dependencies
$ npm i -D babel-jest babel-preset-gatsby
```

Oh snap! I received an error trying to install those Babel dependencies:

```sh
rob@rb app % npm i -D babel-jest babel-preset-gatsby
npm WARN tsutils@3.17.1 requires a peer of typescript@>=2.8.0 || >= 3.2.0-dev || >= 3.3.0-dev || >= 3.4.0-dev || >= 3.5.0-dev || >= 3.6.0-dev || >= 3.6.0-beta || >= 3.7.0-dev || >= 3.7.0-beta but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

npm ERR! code EEXIST

```

So...Let's see how we can fix this:

```sh
# Install TypeScript as a peer dependency of the Babel plugins
$ npm install typescript

# Remove node_modules folder from the local install
$ rm -rf node_modules/

# Install all dependencies
$ npm install

# Now let's try installing those Babel dependencies
$ npm i -D babel-jest babel-preset-gatsby
```

Success! We are back on track.

```sh
# Install the testing library dependencies
$ npm i -D @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react

# Install the identity object proxy
$ npm i -D identity-obj-proxy
```

At this point, we have Jest configured as advised by the example Gatsby repo. Let's add a `test` script to `package.json` and give it a whirl:

```sh
ob@rb app % npm test

> gatsby-starter-default@0.1.0 test /Users/rob/repos/100-days-of-gatsby/100-days-of-gatsby/day-21/app
> jest

No tests found, exiting with code 1
Run with `--passWithNoTests` to exit with code 0

```

Excellent. No tests have been found. Let's replace our `src/pages` and `src/components` folders with the example from the Gatsby repo:

```sh
$ npm test

> gatsby-starter-default@0.1.0 test /Users/rob/repos/100-days-of-gatsby/100-days-of-gatsby/day-21/app
> jest

Success. Jest has been configured for our project and we have passing tests üíØ
