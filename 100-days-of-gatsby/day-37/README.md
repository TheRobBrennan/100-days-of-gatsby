# Day 37 - Thursday, February 6th, 2020

Today's focus is on resuming the [Gatsby Ecommerce](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/gatsby-ecommerce) course from Level Up Tutorials.

## Course progress

The initial setup of required dependencies for Gatsby and Shopify has been defined. Today included creating and setting up a brand new developer account with Shopify - as well as hooking up a sample private app/store as a Gatsby source.

Latest updates for this are in my repo at [https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-gatsby-ecommerce-shopify](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-gatsby-ecommerce-shopify) - with the [DEMO](https://explore-gatsby-ecommerce-shopify.now.sh) available at [https://explore-gatsby-ecommerce-shopify.now.sh](https://explore-gatsby-ecommerce-shopify.now.sh)
