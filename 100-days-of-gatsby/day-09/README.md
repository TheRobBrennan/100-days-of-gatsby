# Day 09 - Thursday, January 9th, 2020

Today's focus is on the tutorial [Programmatically create pages from data](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-seven/)

## Scratchpad

This tutorial uses the site we created in `day-08` as the starting point:

```sh
# Copy the day 06 example to a new folder
$ cp -r 100-days-of-gatsby/day-08 100-days-of-gatsby/day-09
```
