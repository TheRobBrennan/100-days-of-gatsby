# Day 25 - Saturday, January 25th, 2020

Today's focus is on reviewing the Gatsby store example - with the repo available at [https://github.com/gatsbyjs/store.gatsbyjs.org](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/store.gatsbyjs.org) and a demo of the site available at [https://store.gatsbyjs.org](https://store.gatsbyjs.org)

## Thinking out loud

After cloning the repo into a directory, I followed the same pattern of setting up scaffolding for this app (e.g. making sure that a `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `scripts` defined in appropriate `package.json` files, and updating `now.json` to point to the app).
