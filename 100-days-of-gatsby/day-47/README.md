# Day 47 - Sunday, February 16th, 2020

Today is our last day here at the vacation rental in Oregon, so I'm going to keep today's exercise fairly brief.

One of the things I want to do is incorporate a user registration/login that uses Gatsby for a majority of the code - and the [GRANDstack](https://grandstack.io) - GraphQL, React, Apollo, and Neo4j Database - for dynamic authorization/content.

This will require:

+ Creating a simple project that will allow the user to register an account and login using the [GRANDstack](https://grandstack.io)
+ Explore how I might handle specific roles/permissions in a second mini app
+ Creating an app that uses Gatsby and the new lessons learned in the [GRANDstack](https://grandstack.io) examples
