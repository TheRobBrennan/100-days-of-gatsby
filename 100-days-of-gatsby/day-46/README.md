# Day 46 - Saturday, February 15th, 2020

Today's focus is meant to build on work from day 26. As you might recall, day 26 was spent exploring the Formik forms library. For today, I wanted to take that a step further and explore some possibilities for how I might use React Hooks for creating a multi-step form I would like users to submit.
