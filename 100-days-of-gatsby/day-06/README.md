# Day 06 - Monday, January 6th, 2020

Today's focus is on the tutorial [Data in Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-four/).

One small change today is that this will likely be the last "100 Days of Gatsby" example where I will be using Docker for development. I'm comfortable enough setting it up based on the previous examples, and quite honestly it's just getting more in the way of things than anything.

## Scratchpad

Let's use the Gatsby "hello-world" starter for this example:

```sh
$ npx gatsby new app https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```

Let's install some dependencies that this tutorial requires:

```sh
$ npm install --save gatsby-plugin-typography typography react-typography typography-theme-kirkham gatsby-plugin-emotion @emotion/core
```
