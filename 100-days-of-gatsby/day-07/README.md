# Day 07 - Tuesday, January 7th, 2020

Today's focus is on the tutorial [Source Plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/).

## Scratchpad

This tutorial uses the site we created in `day-06` as the starting point:

```sh
# Copy the day 06 example to a new folder
$ cp -r 100-days-of-gatsby/day-06 100-days-of-gatsby/day-07
```
