# Day 30 - Thursday, January 30th, 2020

Today's focus is on starting the [Gatsby Ecommerce](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/gatsby-ecommerce) course from Level Up Tutorials.

## Course progress

I have created a repo at [https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-gatsby-ecommerce](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-gatsby-ecommerce) to explore working with Gatsby and e-commerce.

So far, I've set up a Dockerized development environment for this app. While getting the environment and tooling setup, I have watched videos 0 - 3 - successfully generating a test key via the Stripe UI and connecting to the Stripe SDK in my Gatsby app.
