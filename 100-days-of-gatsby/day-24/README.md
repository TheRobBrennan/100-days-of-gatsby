# Day 24 - Friday, January 24th, 2020

With today being a super chaotic day for me (preparing for my band's first show of the year tonight), I opted to have a relaxed focus on exploring responsive layouts in Gatsby.

These ideas aren't Gatsby-specific - they are guidelines and thoughts that could be applied to any React app or front-end project.
