# Welcome

This repo has been created to store my thoughts and ideas for exploring [100 Days Of Gatsby - Our Guided Coding Challenge for 2020](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/)

Follow the discussion on Twitter with the hashtag [#100DaysOfGatsby](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfGatsby)

## Project organization

This repo has been organized so that you can follow along with me and see the finished state of each of my 100 days of Gatsby. Simply open up the `100-days-of-gatsby` folder and you will see directories with names such as `day-01`, `day-02-gatsby-new`, etc.
