# Day 13 - Monday, January 13th, 2020

Today's task will be to simply generate a new site using the Gatsby CLI and deploy it to my favorite static and [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org) host - [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co).

## Scratchpad

```sh
# Make sure we've navigated to our directory
$ cd 100-days-of-gatsby/day-13

# Generate a new Gatsby project
$ npx gatsby-cli new app

```
