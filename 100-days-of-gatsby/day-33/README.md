# Day 33 - Sunday, February 2nd, 2020

Today's focus is on resuming the [Gatsby Ecommerce](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/gatsby-ecommerce) course from Level Up Tutorials.

## Course progress

I've wrapped up part I of this series - which is basic integration with [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

Latest updates for this are in my repo at [https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-gatsby-ecommerce](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/explore-gatsby-ecommerce)
