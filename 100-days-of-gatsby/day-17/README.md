# Day 17 - Friday, January 17th, 2020

Today's focus is on adding Google Analytics to the default app generated by the Gatsby CLI using [gatsby-plugin-gtag](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-gtag/)

**PREREQUISITES**: This assumes that you have already created or defined a property in Google Analytics with a tracking ID that you would like to use for this example. For the purposes of this demo project, I have created a configuration file - `now.json` - so that I can deploy sites on [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/dashboard) at the URL [https://100-days-of-gatsby.therobbrennan.now.sh](https://100-days-of-gatsby.therobbrennan.now.sh)

## Scratchpad

### Generate a new app using the Gatsby CLI OR the existing Dockerized example

To create a new Gatsby app, I will use `npx` to create a new [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) app using the latest version of the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com):

```sh
# Generate a new app using the latest version of the Gatsby CLI
$ npx gatsby new app
  # OPTIONAL: Copy the Dockerized Gatsby CLI example to an appropriate folder for a faster starting point
  $ cp -r 100-days-of-gatsby/default-gatsby-cli-app-dockerized 100-days-of-gatsby/day-##

# Navigate to the appropriate example directory
$ cd 100-days-of-gatsby/day-##

# Navigate to the app directory
$ cd app
```

Let's get started:

```sh
# Install gatsby-plugin-gtag
$ npm install gatsby-plugin-gtag

# Update 100-days-of-gatsby/day-17/app/gatsby-config.js
```
